**Uses React, Tailwind** </br>
Frontend Implementation of online store in which basic **CRUD operations** can be performed. </br>
**To make Create operation work properly:** Uncomment the "productFetcher()" in "context.jsx" once, Then add a product and again comment it out. This will save the called API data in the localStorage. -Too broke to pay for a writable API :)
